# Object Detective: A Desktop App
* Current version: Alpha 0.95
* **Note:** Application is currently in Turkish language. There'll be English version in final.
For Turkish documentation [click here](./tr_documentation.md)!
### About
- **Goal**: Detect track and count the object according to its horizontal direction. 
- Object Detective is an **open-source** cross-platform desktop application written in Python. It uses MySQL server to store its data and it requires an *login system*. 
- You can use this code for your own purposes however **if you need technical support, please consult us. You can reach out via email or LinkedIn for the right price and customized version for your purpose of our app.**
- Currently our app supports for one-class object detection (which is *cows* right now) however anyone who is eligible enough, can train their own **TensorFlow** model and use this algorithm with it.

**Final notes:** Soon my colleagues will be sharing the cow dataset that we pictured and organized for training the model.
